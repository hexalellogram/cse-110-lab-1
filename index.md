Here's a photo of me!

## Introduction

I'm Bryce, an aspiring DevOps/Software/Security Engineer. I'm currently a second year student at UC San Diego, studying for a B.S. in Computer Science.

I'm originally from Orange County in Southern California.

## Work Experience

### Amazon

This summer, I'll be working at **Amazon** as a Security Engineer Intern.

### Other Experience

Previously, I worked as a summer camp instructor for the **Bay Area Cyber League**, a cybersecurity educational organization in Northern California.

I also interned at **Cal State Fullerton** for the summer of 2018 studying research into the consumer perceptions of cybersecurity in healthcare with Professor Shawn X. Wang.

## Programmer

In my spare time, I've made quite a few personal projects and team projects.

These include but are not limited to:

- [mac-setup](https://github.com/hexalellogram/mac-setup) which is a set of Bash scripts to quickly set up a new macOS computer with my preferred applications and settings.
- ACM Profiles ([Frontend](https://github.com/acmucsd/acm-profiles-ui) and [Backend](https://github.com/acmucsd/acm-profiles-api)) which is a convenient place for ACM at UCSD members to share their social media and form communities.
- [Safari Sideloader](https://github.com/hexalellogram/SafariSideloader) which is a Python script to convert Chrome WebExtensions to ones compatible with Apple Safari on macOS.
- [FlyerScanner](https://github.com/hexalellogram/FlyerScanner) which is an application to scan event flyers and automatically add them to your calendar.
- [Canvas Year In Review](https://github.com/cool00geek/canvas-year) which is a Chrome extension to help you gather statistics on your Canvas experience with online learning in 2020.
- [Boredgon Trailder](https://github.com/hexalellogram/boredgon-trailder) which is a mashup of a networking app and the classic game *The Oregon Trail*

My favorite programming language was ~~at first PowerShell because it was the first one I learned,~~ but then I learned Java, and now I'm learning Python. Those 2 are my favorites.

I suppose, that in order, my favorite languages are:

1. Python
2. Java (even though I know more Java)

## Quotes

Yoda once said the following. This is a **very _important_ piece of advice!**

> Do or do not, there is no try.

***Listen to Yoda.***

## Code

Here's some code for a Hello World program in Java!

```java
public class Driver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

To compile this, you would run `javac Driver.java` assuming that your filename is `Driver.java`.

## Things to Do

Here are some things that I want to do!

- [x] Get into CSE 110
